# AI-Driven Continuous Steering Control for Autonomous Parking
## Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms SAC, PPO & TD3

A research-oriented implementation of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents for precise, continuous steering control in fixed-slot autonomous parking.

## 🔍 Overview

Autonomous parking demands fine-grained steering control in tight spaces. Leveraging a Unity 3D physics–based car model with differential-drive constraints, this project explores reward-augmented RL methods to guide vehicles smoothly into parking slots.

## 🚧 Research in Progress

- **Manuscript Under Preparation**  
  A detailed study comparing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)—evaluating convergence speed, success rates, and trajectory smoothness—will be published soon.  
- **Core Code Available**  
  - Unity 3D environment setup  
  - Continuous-action SAC and PPO agents  
  - Custom reward function balancing collision avoidance, efficiency, and alignment  

## ⚙️ What’s Expected

- **Simulation**: Unity 3D car dynamics with steering constraints (Markov Decision Process)  
- **Agents**: Modular SAC and PPO implementations in ML-Agents
- **Metrics**: Scripts for logging success rate, convergence curves, and policy stability
